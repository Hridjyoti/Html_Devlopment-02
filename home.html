            <P style="font-size:20px;">
                One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a
                rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in
                the
                world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to
                the
                tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from
                the
                rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct
                geographical entity.Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the
                Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the
                Arabian
                Sea on the west. As you travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of
                cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history and adventure sports. India
                has a
                mesmeric conflation of the old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky
                shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential
                traveller
                can get the best of both worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through the
                golden Thar, India has options galore for all.
